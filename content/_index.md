# Christian Berrig

## whoami

My name is Christian Berrig.  

## [Academia](/academia/index.html)

I have a M.Sc in physics from University of Copenhagen.  
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [PandemiX
group](https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center) at
[RUC](https://ruc.dk/) doing mathematical modelling and simulations of
evolution and dynamics of infectious diseases.

### [Notes](/text/notes/index.html)

I have written some [notes](/text/notes/index.html) regarding subjects,
that interests me, e.g. are on Mathematics, Physics, Epidemiology and
Programming. I continually update this collection of notes.

## [Software](/software/index.html)

I am working on a few small software projects. This is to keep in shape
w.r.t. programming, and if anyone would like to benefit from this, they
are welcome :)  
I currently have a [github](https://github.com/chrberrig), where you can
access my code.
