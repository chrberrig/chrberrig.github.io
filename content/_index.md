# Christian Berrig

## whoami

My name is Christian Berrig.  

## [Academia](/academia/index.html)

I have a M.Sc in physics from University of Copenhagen.  
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the 
[PandemiX group](https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center) at
[RUC](https://ruc.dk/) studying mathematical modelling and simulations of
evolution and dynamics of infectious diseases.

### Notes

I have written some [notes](/text/notes) regarding subjects, that interests me academically.
Specifically these subjects are Mathematics, Physics, Epidemiology, Biology and Programming.
I am by far no expert in any field alone, and do this to document my own experiences in these fields.
I continually update this collection of notes, which is by no means comprehensive.

### Software

I am working on a few small [software](/software) projects. 
This is to keep in shape w.r.t. programming, 
and if anyone would like to benefit from this, they are welcome :)  
I currently have a [github](https://github.com/chrberrig), where you can access my code.
