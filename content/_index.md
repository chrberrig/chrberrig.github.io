My name is Christian Berrig.  

## Education and [Academia](/academia/index.html)
I have my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in physics from the
University of Copenhagen.  
After a year as a physics and maths teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, I
decided to go back to Academia.  
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [PandemiX group](https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center) at [RUC](https://ruc.dk/), doing mathematical modelling of evolution and dynamics of infectious diseases.  
You can find my ORCID [here](/contact), if you want to follow my research.

### Software
I am working on a few small [software](/software) projects. 
This is to keep in shape w.r.t. programming, 
and if anyone would like to benefit from this, they are welcome :)  
I currently have a [github](https://github.com/chrberrig), where you can access my code.
