## Software Projects

I have a few small software projects that I am working on. Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, they are welcome to do so :)  

I currently have a [github](https://github.com/chrberrig) page, where you can access my code, which is (in accordance with my views on free software) licensed under GPL. My plan is to eventually move my projects to a remote repo that is not economically dependent on Micro$oft, or any of the other digital enslavement organizations.
