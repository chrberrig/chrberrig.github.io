# Malthusian and Wrightian fitness

When talking about fitness, there are two obvious descriptive ways in which this can be expressed:

- A "per generation" description (Writhian) in which the fitness is described generationally, decoupled from "real/proper time" describing the generational growth of an allele in a population from the 
- a continuous time desciption (Malthusian) descibing the "real-time" dynamics, but not the "per-generation" description of allele abundancies. 
  
These two frames coincides if there are synchonous changes in the wrigtian generational frame, such that the whole generation is "replaced" by the new generation after a specified duration of  time which also sets the unit time-scale in this special description. 

In both wrightian and malthusian description, there are two possible contribution to changes in the abundancies of the alelles in competition:
- natural selection, which describe the changes in anbundancy of each allele due to the variation in the growth of each constituant \(p_{i})\ of the population. 
- dynamical effects, whiuch are explicit temporal dependency on the reproduction of each allele, such as e.g. fluctuations in fitness over time, mutations between quasi-species constituants etc.
