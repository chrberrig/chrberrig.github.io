## Interests and hobbies

I Enjoy tinkering with computers and reading. 
My latest interests include the ethical, technical and legislative battles fought in regards
to the digital space, public goods and economic distribution/equality.

### Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy

I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. I am a
member of the currently functioning society for free software in Denmark
"Fri software netv√¶rk". This is a society independent of both
[FSF](https://www.fsf.org/) and [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), but pretty
aligned in their causes. My function in this society so far have been in
outreach and communication, but this is mainly due to me going rogue in
order to get anything done at all. :)

### This is my online presence\!

There are many reasons to make a website. Mine are, that I would like to
maximize personal independence when it concerns the digital space. I aim
to do so while also in several different ways:

  - Using code that is licensed with [copyleft
    licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)
  - Minimizing the code base I use that allows this high degree of
    independence.

Social media platforms are therefore quite undesirable to me, since
these not only discourage, but also disallow digital independence. The
personal website is an awesome alternative. Building a website also
provides you with a chance to get a little insight in the technicalities
of how the internet works. This also makes it clear why [most of the web
is currently broken](https://suckless.org/sucks/web/).
