On Social credit systems and capitalist incentives and how they manipulate and shape human behaviour, and how digital frameworks datamining people for profit or ideological seering undermine individuality and freedom of expression. 
A thesis that is, if not adjacent then related, to the one described by Zuboff in "The age of surveillance capitalism", although I find this work a bit more concise, while taking into account the comparison between the ideological and capitalist motivations.
