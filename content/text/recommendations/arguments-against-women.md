*by Professor emerita, Dr. Phil. Birgitte Possing*

A brilliant history and summary of the fight for emancipation (so far) of women in a danish context, and the arguments and resistance against this emancipation.
Tragicomic in the absurdity of the arguments presented, and, to me, both very educational and entertaining.
