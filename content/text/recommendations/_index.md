## Reading/watching/listening recommendations

This is simply a list of some reading I have done which I can recommend
for both entertainment and education. The list is probably not
comprehensive, but I will make the attempt to make it so and to keep it
updated.

### Books

  - **Arguments against women (Argumenter imod kvinder - fra demokratiets barndom til i dag)** 
    by Professor emerita, Dr. Phil. Birgitte Possing  
    A brilliant history and summary of the fight for emancipation (so
    far) of women in a danish context, and the arguments and resistance
    against this emancipation.
  - **The age of surveillance capitalism** by Professor Shoshanna
    Zuboff  
    Fantastic intellectual work on the capitalistic model of user data
    in the digital age, and the consequences for the diminishing of the
    individuals power in a society in which such a digital frameworks
    exists. This is very close to the main canonical text on this
    subject.
  - **Digital totalitarianism (Digital totalitarisme)** by PhD Mads
    Vestergaard  
    On Social credit systems and capitalist incentives and how they
    manipulate and shape human behaviour though digital frameworks. A
    thesis is, if not adjacent then related, to the one described by
    Zuboff in "The age of surveillance capitalism".

### Comics and graphic novels

  - **V for vendetta** by Allan Moore and David Lloyd  
    A accessible analysis of the role of anarchism in the totalitarian state, done through compelling storytelling, set in the dystopian future of 1980's England. 
    Also, watch the movie, it is (in my opinion) an excellent adaptation\!

### Short stories

  - **I have no mouth and I must scream** by Harlan Ellison  
    Interesting sci-fi for the relation and ethics between human beings
    and a concious machine.
  - **Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote** by Jorge Luis Borges  
    A fantasticaly funny text on reading, writing, and interpretation of
    text.

### Academic papers

  - **Reflections on Trusting Trust** by Ken Thompson  
    Excelent paper, that do not require any prerequisites other than a
    small amout of intelligence. Just read it\!
