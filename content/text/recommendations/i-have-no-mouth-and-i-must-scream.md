by Harlan Ellison  

Interesting sci-fi for the relation and ethics between human beings and a concious machine.
Beside the comment on the ethical consideration associated with the control over concious beings, as illustrated by the reversal of roles between the artificial intelligence that under normal circumstances, can be shut down, and humans. 
It is also a fantastically uncomfortable piece of body-horror.
