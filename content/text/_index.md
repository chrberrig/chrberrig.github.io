# Text

This page is for references to texts, both of my own making but also the
texts of others that I really like for all sorts of different reasons.

## Publications

I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics, and since
I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information, much of
the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential so quantum
theory. Since my focus recently changed to mathematical modelling of
infectious diseases, much of recent education in mathematics have been
characterized of applied mathematics, in particular in networks,
dynamical systems and computational/numerical modelling. I have compiled
a list of my [publications of academic papers](/academia/publications.html).

## Notes

The notes I have written, are primarily for my own sake. They contain
results from physics and mathematics. You are free to use these notes
for any non-commercial use you see fit, and may share them freely, again
under the restriction that it is for non-commercial use only. My notes
are accessible [here](/text/notes/index.html)

## Reading/watching/listening recommendations

This is simply a list of some reading I have done which I can recommend
for both entertainment and education. The list is probably not
comprehensive, but I will make the attempt to make it so and to keep it
updated.
