I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics, and since
I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information, much of
the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential to quantum
theory. Since my focus changed to mathematical modelling of infectious
diseases, much of recent education in mathematics have been
characterized by applied mathematics, graph theory, adaptive dynamics,
complex and stochastic modelling, and dynamical systems.

## Areas of interest

### Bayesian inference

### Cryptology/cryptography

Self-study. I attempt to implement solutions for such problems as a check
that I have really understood the subjects. My implementations can be
seen on my [git repo](chrberrig).
