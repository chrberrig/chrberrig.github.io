## Outreach

I have also done quite a bit in science communication and outreach, both
in regard to mathematics and physics.

### Copenhagen Science Slam

Like poetry slam, but with short science-talks. I won in 2011, with the
special theory of relativity, and after that assisted in arranging a
couple of science slams.

### Matematikcenter

I have been a volunteer at Matematikcenter, a non-profit organization
for homework-help and teaching in mathematics targeted at high-school
students. In that process, I have recorded some 30-ish videos, that can
be viewed on [Matematikcenters
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Et2H2140L8cNaT4XPgnrQ).
