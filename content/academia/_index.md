## Programming

Through my education in physics, not much programming were (surprisingly) needed. 
After I were actually in an environment in which I needed to APPLY knowledge (shocks\!) to disease modelling, I have become much more comfortable both with programming and computers. 
Beside the now over 10-ish years I have with Python and \\LaTeX that (almost) every physicist eventually will acquire, I have also now, during the last 5-ish years, dipped my toes in C, C++. Git and Ansible, with which I am also familiarizing myself, are not programming languages, but tools
for version-control and automation respectively, which are indispensable for programming. 
HTML do not count as programming (and neither do \\LaTeX, but for some reason it seems like a lot of people find \\LaTeX much more difficult than HTML). 
You are of course welcome to check out some of my projects on my repository [here](https://github.com/chrberrig), but i warn you; Its an unholy mess\!

## Outreach

I have also done quite a bit in science communication and outreach, both
in regard to mathematics and physics.

### Copenhagen Science Slam

Like poetry slam, but with short science-talks. I won in 2011, with the
special theory of relativity, and after that assisted in arranging a
couple of science slams.

### Matematikcenter

I have been a volunteer at Matematikcenter, a non-profit organization
for homework-help and teaching in mathematics targeted at high-school
students. In that process, I have recorded some 30-ish videos, that can
be viewed on [Matematikcenters
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Et2H2140L8cNaT4XPgnrQ).
