I have compiled a list of my publications here, that I maintain.
I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics, and since I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information, much of the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential so quantum theory. 
Since my focus changed for my PhD to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, much of recent education in mathematics have been characterized of applied mathematics, in particular in networks, dynamical systems and computational/numerical modelling. 

In case you want to keep up with my scientific work i can offer the following:
a RSS-feed for keeping up with my scientific publications:
