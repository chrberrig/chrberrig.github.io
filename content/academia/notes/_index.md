The notes that exists on this site, are notes written primarily for my own sake. 
Partially as an exercise in checking that I have actually understood a subject, partially to save and communicate this knowledge. 
You are free to use these notes for any non-commercial use you see fit, and may share them freely, again under the restriction that it is for non-commercial use only. 
It is work in process, and I upload these notes as I get them transcribed. 
My notes on are accessible [here](/academia/notes).
