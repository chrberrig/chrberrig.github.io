## Feynman Parametrization
So, I wrote a [note on Feynman parametrisation](/tex/single_notes/feynman_parametrizasion_proof.pdf). 
It is a quite simple proof of the entire parametrisation scheme, which I haven't found anywhere else, although some of the simpler cases of similar identities come quite close, and uses the same techniques. 
I hope you enjoy it, and find it useful.
