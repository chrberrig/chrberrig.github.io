[Pubs](https://github.com/pubs/pubs) is a bibliography management tool on the command-line. 

I can highly recommend it from a user-experience perspective as a Linux-user, although more widely applied tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) have more features. 
This however is far from necessary, and I personally want a smaller tool that is extendable though a CLI, rather than a massive tool that is not. 
Furthermore, pubs has a customizable git integration, making syncing of bibliographies between machines (almost) painless.
