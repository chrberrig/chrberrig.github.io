	<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<h2 id="software-projects">Software Projects</h2>
<p>I have a few small software projects that I am working on. Mostly it is
for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, but if
anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, they are
welcome to do so :)<br>
I currently have a <a href="https://github.com/chrberrig">github</a> page, where
you can access my code, which is (in accordance with my views on free
software) licensed under GPL. My plan is to eventually move my projects
to a remote repo that is not economically dependent on Micro$oft, or any
of the other digital enslavement organizations.</p>
<h3 id="free-software-privacy-digital-slavery-and-democracy">Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy</h3>
<p>I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. I am a
member of the currently functioning society for free software in Denmark
&ldquo;Fri software netv√¶rk&rdquo; that is independent of both
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, but pretty
aligned in their causes.<br>
My function in this society so far have been in outreach and
communication, which I enjoy. This have in particular been focusing on
high-school students as an awareness campaign.</p>
<p>I believe (I don&rsquo;t try to preach, you are totally entitled to your own
opinion, man), that the current way of how the web functions, is
somewhere in-between economically and democratically unsustainable, to
problematic. The way platforms in particular incentivise people to
become dependent of their &ldquo;services&rdquo;. The role social media have taken
as a form of privatized public space in digital format, is from my point
of view currently enslaving its users in the digital space. Thus, I dub
the far majority of the large tech-companies &ldquo;Digital enslavement
organizations&rdquo;.</p>
