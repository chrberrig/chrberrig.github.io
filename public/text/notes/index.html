	<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>The notes that exists on this site, are notes written primarily for my
own sake. partially as an exercise in checking that I have actually
understood a subject, partially to save and communicate this knowledge.
You are free to use these notes for any non-commercial use you see fit,
and may share them freely, again under the restriction that it is for
non-commercial use only.</p>
<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<p>I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics and, since
I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information, much of
the mathematics I picked up along the way is tangential so quantum
theory. There are of course single pieses of math or proofs which are
completely unrelated to anything else I have done that I have included
on the sole merit that i find them quite enjoyable. I am currently in
the process of transcribing a lot of my notes into TeX, so they will be
uploaded as I get them done.</p>
<h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>
<p>I received a masters degree in physics from University of Copenhagen in
2017, and like the notes from mathematics, these are transcribed to TeX,
so these will be updated and uploaded as they get done.</p>
<h3 id="feynman-parametrization">Feynman Parametrization</h3>
<p>So, I wrote a <a href="/text/notes/feynman_parametrizasion_proof.pdf">note on Feynman
parametrisation</a>. It is a
quite simple proof of the entire parametrisation scheme, which I haven&rsquo;t
found anywhere else, although some of the simpler cases of similar
identities come quite close, and uses the same techniques. I hope you
enjoy it, and find it useful.</p>
<h2 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology</h2>
<p>I am currently working in mathematical epidemiology, and due to the
current state of the world with the COVID-19 pandemic going on, that is
quite dominating for my work, which currently involves massive amounts
of data being analysed. My main focus though is on more general models
for dynamic disease modelling.</p>
